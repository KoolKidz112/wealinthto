## Local setup guide
NPM packages should come pre-installed, but I am an idiot who doesn't know anything about node.js so if all else fails:
```
npm install -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
```
Then navigate to /public/ and open index.html in your browser. No extra setup is required, JavaScript handles everything
